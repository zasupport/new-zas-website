  { title: 'Service Battery Warning', desc: 'macOS shows "Service Recommended" when battery health drops below 80%. This is Apple\'s signal that the cells are degraded and runtime will continue to decrease. We replace same-day with a genuine-spec battery that restores full macOS health reporting.' },
  { title: 'Swollen / Expanding Battery', desc: 'A swollen battery is a safety issue. It pushes against the trackpad causing stiffness or phantom clicks, and can warp the bottom case. Do not charge or use a MacBook with a swollen battery. We handle safe removal and disposal. This is the most urgent battery fault, bring it in immediately.' },
  { title: 'Rapid Drain (Under 3 Hours)', desc: 'If your MacBook lasts under 3 hours on light tasks, the battery cells are degraded beyond useful capacity. South African load shedding accelerates this, constant charge-discharge cycling wears cells faster than normal use. We test actual capacity, not just the macOS percentage.' },
  { title: 'Not Charging', desc: 'Failure to charge can be a battery fault or a logic board fault. If the MagSafe light does not illuminate or the charging icon does not appear, the issue may be the charge controller on the board rather than the battery itself. Our assessment distinguishes the two before quoting, you pay only for what is actually broken.' },
  { title: 'Battery Percentage Stuck', desc: 'The battery indicator stuck at one percentage, or jumping erratically between numbers, indicates a failed battery gauge circuit or degraded cells that cannot hold a consistent voltage. This is a battery replacement, not a software issue.' },
  { title: 'Shutdown at 20-30%', desc: 'The MacBook shuts down suddenly at 20% or 30% remaining, the cells can no longer deliver the voltage macOS needs under even light load. The battery is reporting inaccurate capacity. Replacement resolves this completely.' },

const faqs = [
  { question: 'Do you collect MacBooks for battery replacement from Melville?', answer: 'Yes, collection from Melville is a short run for us. From our Hyde Park workshop it is roughly 8 km via Jan Smuts and Empire Road, typically 12-18 minutes outside of peak. We collect from homes on 1st through 4th Avenues, the guesthouse strip, and the cafés and offices along 7th Street. WhatsApp 064 529 5863 with your address and a window that suits you.' },
  { question: 'How much does MacBook battery replacement cost for Melville clients?', answer: 'Battery replacement varies by model, older 13-inch Airs sit at the lower end, while 16-inch Pros with the larger cell pack cost more. The price includes the battery, fitting, recalibration and a written warranty. An assessment fee applies and is credited against the repair if you proceed. We quote firmly before any work begins, so there are no surprises.' },
  { question: 'How long does MacBook battery replacement take?', answer: 'Most replacements are completed the same day or by the following morning. The physical work takes a few hours, but we run a full calibration cycle afterwards to make sure the battery management system reports accurate health and cycle count. For Melville clients we will often collect mid-morning and return the machine that evening if you are close to 7th Street or Auckland Park.' },
  { question: 'Will replacing my battery erase my data?', answer: 'No, battery replacement is a hardware-only procedure and does not touch your SSD or operating system. Your files, applications and settings remain exactly as they were. That said, we always recommend a Time Machine backup or iCloud sync before any repair, simply as good practice. If you do not have a backup drive, we can advise on a suitable external SSD when we collect.' },
  { question: 'How do I check my MacBook battery health?', answer: 'Hold Option and click the Apple menu, then go to System Information → Power. You will see Cycle Count and Condition. Apple rates most modern MacBook batteries for 1000 cycles before they drop to 80% of original capacity. If Condition reads Service Recommended or Service Battery, or if your cycle count is over 800 with noticeable drain, it is time. WhatsApp the screenshot to 064 529 5863 and we will confirm what your machine needs.' },
  {
    question: 'Does load shedding damage MacBook batteries?',
    answer: 'Not directly damage, but it accelerates degradation significantly. Each charge-discharge cycle during load shedding counts toward the battery\'s lifespan. MacBooks used through daily load shedding reach the replacement threshold much faster than those on stable power.',
  },
  { question: 'My trackpad feels stiff, could it be the battery?', answer: 'Almost certainly yes. The battery cells sit directly under the trackpad on most MacBook Pros and Airs, and when a cell swells it lifts the trackpad from below, making clicks feel stiff, uneven or unresponsive. This is the single most common warning sign we see from Melville clients on older machines. Stop using the laptop on charge, do not press hard on the trackpad, and arrange collection, swollen batteries are a fire risk and worth dealing with quickly.' },
  { question: 'Do you offer warranty on battery replacements for Melville clients?', answer: 'Yes, every battery replacement comes with a written warranty covering the cell and the workmanship. If the battery fails to hold charge correctly or shows a fault within the warranty period, we collect from Melville again at no cost and resolve it. We keep records of every repair against your serial number, so there is no paperwork to dig up if you need to come back.' },
